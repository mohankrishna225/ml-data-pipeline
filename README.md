# ML-Data-Pipeline
This Data Pipeline is created as a part of the course mlops guided by ineuron

This project is intended to showcase how kafka can help in collecting data from source to destination 

We will try to implement a datapipeline which helps in collecting iot data from different sensors and storing it in a nosql database like mongodb  

Technologies:
1. Kafka
2. MongoDB
3. Python3
